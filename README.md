<h2>I 💙 to code!</h2>
<br>
I'm Tamra, a current student at Boise CodeWorks. Coding wasn't even on my radar 6 months ago, yet I find myself in love with it today. I love the process of planning, creating, and problem-solving. The struggles are so worth it and the successes are thrilling!

<ul>
<li>💻--I'm currently learning all there is to know about JavaScript and am excited to implement new frameworks.</li>
<li>🌼--My knowledge of code is just a seed right now, but I fully anticipate that it will blossom with the help of CodeWorks and my desire to nurture this growing knowledge.

<li>⭐--Random things about me: I love yoga, snacks, fantasy, and reading. I've never had a cavity. I believe that kindness is the key to change the world. Cows are my favorite animal. I play piano and guitar, but not very well. And I want to be a software developer.😁
