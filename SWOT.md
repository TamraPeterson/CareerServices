Strengths:

    -I enjoy helping others succeed. 
    -I am able to see other people's point of view and be empathetic. 
    -I am reliable and can be counted on to accomplish what I commit to do. 
    -I succeed in leadership roles by ensuring others know what is expected of them and delegating tasks to be sure everything gets done when it needs to. 
    -I am organized and know what needs to be done to accomplish a goal. 
    -I like to make things fun and encourage others to enjoy their tasks.

Weaknesses:

    -I worry about what others think of me and second guess myself. 
    -I want people to like me so I can sometimes take criticism too personally. 
    -I struggle to trust that other people will do things right or on time, and therefore sometimes overload myself rather than delegate. 
    -I sometimes get wrapped up in trying to accomplish something and don't take a break when I need to, making me less productive overall because I'm tired and less efficient. 
    -I don't like confrontation so I will repress feelings rather than address them and communicate. 
    -I rely on positive feedback to motivate me to persevere when things are challenging.

Opportunities:

    -The push for more women/diversity in the tech industry is a good opportunity for me to get a foot in the door.
    -There are a lot of tech jobs available as it is an ever-growing field.
    -The connections we're making at CodeWorks with peers and the Codeworks staff, are great opportunities for networking later on. 
    -I have family and friends who are developers and could provide opportunities to network or improve my skills.

Threats:

    -Going into the tech industry as a female could cause others to underestimate my abilities. 
    -I worry that as I try to prove myself as a woman, I may lose sight of embracing who I truly am. 
    -Some of my weaknesses may be seen as a result of being female, even though many men possess the same weaknesses.
    -I could easily get discouraged by missed opportunities or being turned down by potential employers, causing me to doubt myself more.
