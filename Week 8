I am hoping to get a recommendation from you, Jake, and Mark or Mick. I also was thinking I might ask Courtney to write me one.

I connected on linked in with many people in the last couple weeks. The most recent 10 are:
Chris Taylor, Kody Dudley, Ryan Davis, Miles Wilson, Zach Yentsch, Jordan Engstrom, Jacob Rushlow, 
Nicholas Sondrup, and a couple I was excited about are Jeet Kumar and Neil Whited from In Time Tec. 

A rough draft of the message I sent to some recent connections is:
"Hello ____! Thank you for connecting with me. I noticed you went to Codeworks and now work at ______. I'm currently a student at 
Codeworks and am excited to be in this industry. How do you like working for ______? I've heard it's a great company to work for!"
